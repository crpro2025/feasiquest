## Why Free Sites Don't Work

### 1. **Quality Issues**
Free sites attract low-quality, inactive sites that waste sponsor time.

### 2. **No Commitment**
Sites that don't pay have no skin in the game and often don't respond to opportunities.

### 3. **Unsustainable Business Model**
Can't provide quality service, support, and features without revenue from both sides.

### 4. **Sponsor Expectations**
Sponsors expect to work with serious, committed sites. Free listings signal lack of commitment.

### 5. **Market Precedent**
Every successful platform in this space charges sites. The market has validated this model.

## Recommended Pricing Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch (Months 1-6)
- **Sites:** Free tier + Professional ($199/mo) + Premium ($399/mo)
- **Sponsors:** Professional ($2,499/mo) + Enterprise ($4,999/mo)
- **Goal:** Acquire 100 paid sites, 20 paid sponsors

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 7-12)
- **Sites:** Limit free tier to 3 months trial, then require upgrade
- **Sponsors:** Add Starter tier ($999/mo) for small biotech
- **Goal:** 500 paid sites, 50 paid sponsors

### Phase 3: Scale (Year 2+)
- **Sites:** Phase out free tier entirely or make it very limited
- **Sponsors:** Introduce usage-based pricing for high-volume users
- **Goal:** 2,000+ paid sites, 200+ paid sponsors
