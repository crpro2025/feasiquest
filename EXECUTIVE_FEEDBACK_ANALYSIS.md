## 📋 SUMMARY OF KEY FEEDBACK

### Critical Comments Identified:

#### 1. **Dependency on Sponsor Type** (Page 2, Comment 1)
**Feedback:** "This will differ depending on whether the person is from: CRO or sponsor"

**Context:** Regarding what contributes to feasibility failures
- Sponsor or CRO selecting wrong sites
- Site's lack of understanding of protocol/patient journey
- Site's overconfidence in ability to enroll
- Competing studies
- Ability of site to effectively recruit and consent patients
- Limited site resources or site has too many studies

**Action Required:** Differentiate content based on user type (Sponsor vs. CRO)

---

#### 2. **Comprehensive Failure Factors** (Page 2, Comment 2)
**Feedback:** Detailed list of what contributes to feasibility failures:
- Sponsor or CRO selecting wrong sites
- Site's lack of understanding of the protocol or patient journey
- Site's overconfidence in ability to enroll
- Competing studies
- Ability of the site to effectively recruit and consent patients
- Limited site resources or site has too many studies to effectively manage

**Action Required:** Incorporate all these factors into the platform's assessment tools

---

#### 3. **Training for All Experience Levels** (Page 2, Comment 3)
**Feedback:** "I recommend this be part of training for all experience levels."

**Context:** Regarding feasibility fundamentals

**Action Required:** Make foundational content mandatory for all users regardless of experience

---

#### 4. **Faster Enrollment Definition** (Page 3, Comment 1)
**Feedback:** "Poor feasibility can cause a study to enroll significantly faster than projected, if the projections are too conservative. This has additional down stream impacts such as clinical supply and drug supply issues, data monitoring issues, etc. A good feasibility assessment is one that results in predictable delivery of a study within an acceptable window of the projected study timeline."

**Action Required:** 
- Redefine "good feasibility" as predictable delivery within acceptable timeline window
- Address both under-enrollment AND over-enrollment risks
- Include downstream impacts (supply chain, data monitoring)

---

#### 5. **Sponsor Type Variations** (Page 3, Comment 2)
**Feedback:** "This can vary based on the sponsor. Biotechs and small pharma will have different perspectives and approaches compared to large pharma or commercial stage companies."

**Action Required:** Create different perspectives/modules for:
- Large Pharma
- Small Pharma/Biotech
- Commercial Stage Companies
- CROs

---

#### 6. **Interactive Definition Builder** (Page 3, Comment 3)
**Feedback:** "I'm interested in this definition."

**Context:** Regarding "What is Feasibility?" - Interactive Definition Builder

**Action Required:** Prioritize development of interactive definition builder tool

---

#### 7. **Trial Equity & Diversity** (Page 4, Comment 1)
**Feedback:** "Don't forget about trial equity and creating a strategy to recruit a diverse patient population. Regardless of changes to DEI initiatives, it remains imperative for nearly all sponsors that the study enrolls a representative population."

**Action Required:**
- Add dedicated section on trial equity and diversity
- Include DEI recruitment strategies
- Emphasize representative population enrollment

---

#### 8. **Line of Treatment Considerations** (Page 4, Comment 2)
**Feedback:** "What about line of treatment?"

**Context:** Patient population and recruitment feasibility

**Action Required:** Add line of treatment as a key consideration in patient recruitment modules
